      <h2>Ways to Help!</h2>
      <p class="w3-justify">
        <h3>
          Save the Wetlands
        </h3>
        <li>Participate in programs that help protect and restore wetlands. Contact local, state, or federal agencies, community groups, environmental organizations and other non-government organizations. See American Wetlands Month events.</li>
<li>Report illegal actions such as unauthorized wetland fill or dredging activities to government authorities, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.</li>
<li>Pick up litter and dispose in appropriate trash containers. Keep surface areas that wash into storm drains clean from pet waste, toxic chemicals, fertilizers and motor oil, which can eventually reach and impair our wetlands.</li>
<li>Use native species when planting trees, shrubs and flowers to preserve the ecological balance of local wetlands.</li>
<li>Use "living shoreline" techniques that make use of plant roots to stabilize soil if you own waterfront property and your shoreline or river bank needs to be stabilized.</li>
<li>Avoid wetlands if you are expanding your house or installing a shed.</li>
<li>Use phosphate-free laundry and dishwasher detergents. Phosphates encourage algae growth, which can suffocate aquatic life.</li>
<li>Use paper and recycled products made from unbleached paper. Bleached paper contains toxic chemicals that can contaminate water.</li>
<li>Use non-toxic products for household cleaning and lawn and garden care. Never spray lawn and garden chemicals outside on a windy day or on a day that it might rain and wash the chemicals into waterways.</li>
<li>Enjoy the scenic and recreational opportunities coastal wetlands offer, while preserving their integrity for future generations by minimizing the use of heavy equipment and staying in designated visitor areas where available.</li>
        <h3>Energy Conservation</h3>

<li>Switch to a renewable electricity supplier.</li>
<li>Buy A-rated electrical appliances.</li>
<li>Switch to energy saving light bulbs, when your old bulbs break. They last around 10 times longer than ordinary light bulbs; they will save you money and come in loads of different styles.</li>
<li>Items left on standby can use up to 85% of the energy they would use if fully switched on. Turn them off at the wall – it doesn’t take long.</li>
<li>Electric tumble dryers use a huge amount of energy. If it’s a nice day dry your clothes outside or even inside if it’s not so nice.</li>
<li>When using a washing machine ensure there is a full load and turn down the temperature.</li>
<li>If you have lights in your garden use solar powered lights that charge during the day and don’t require electricity.</li>
<li>Take your phone charger out of the wall. It uses energy even when it’s not charging your phone.

</li>
<li>When washing dishes by hand, don’t let the water run. Fill one basin with wash water and the other with rinse water.</li>
<li>Install an aerator on your kitchen faucet to reduce flow to less than 1 gallon per minute.</li>
<li>Use the garbage disposal sparingly. Alternatively, you can compost vegetable food waste and save gallons of water every time.</li>
<li>Install low-flow shower heads.</li>
<li>Take a five minute shower instead of a 10 minute one.</li>
<li>Turn your bathroom faucet off when brushing your teeth or shaving.</li>

<li>Water early in the morning or later in the evening when temperatures are cooler.</li>
<li>Adjust your sprinklers to ensure only your yard is being watered, not your house, sidewalk or street.</li>
<li>Put a layer of mulch around trees and plants to reduce evaporation and keep the soil cool.</li>
<li>Landscape your yard with climate appropriate plants.</li>
<li>Use a broom instead of a hose to clean driveways, sidewalks and patios.</li>
<li>Wash vehicles with a bucket and sponge, and make sure your hose has a self-closing nozzle.</li>
<h3>Other Ways to Take Action</h3>
<li>Contact City Council to set ordinances that regulate waste and chemical Use</li>
  <li>Get to know the rules of recycling.</li>
  <li>Ditch the plastic bags.</li>
  <li> Make a meal plan.</li>
  <li> Start relying on reusable containers.</li>
  <li>Start composting.</li>
  <li>Learn to repair rather than discard.</li>
  <li>Cancel unnecessary mail.</li>
  <li>Stop using disposable plates.</li>
  <li>Stop buying plastic water bottles. Buy reusable bottles.</li>
