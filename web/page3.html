    <h2>Environmental Issues</h2>
    <div class="w3-justify">
      <p>The Central Region of the United States is home to many national parks and species. It is the biggest region of agricultural production. It is also an area prone to wildfires. Use of pesticides is now an all time high. Energy is created using fossil fuels which causes an increase of greenhouse gases.Clean and abundant water is essential for all life. It is likewise a basic ingredient in our economic well-being. This is a truth that our state’s leaders acknowledged when they adopted the Public Trust Doctrine in to the Wisconsin Constitution. The Public Trust Doctrine states that the waters of the state are held in trust by the state for the use of its citizens. That means that Wisconsin’s many lakes, rivers, trout streams, creeks, streams and even the groundwater belong to us all. We all benefit from them and the water’s health is important to us all.
Water is protected by state and federal laws that protect both water quality and its quantity. The central most important law is the Clean Water Act, enacted by Congress in 1972. Wisconsin, like all other states, has its own set of laws to protect water quality, based upon what the Clean Water Act requires. These laws, at their most simplistic, seek to set rules and regulations that set scientific standards for what is considered “clean” water, eliminate pollution, clean up polluted water and keep clean water clean. However, waste still manages to pollute water systems.
There are federal Clean Air Act and corresponding state regulations for the six most common pollutants: ground level ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, and lead. Other chemicals are regulated through state permits. Short term exposure to these and other air-borne chemicals can cause mild headaches and irritation. Long term exposures, or exposure to high levels of the chemicals, can lead to an increased risk of cancer, aggravated asthma, and neurological problems. Some of these chemicals are still released in to the atmosphere and damage not our bodies, but the environment as well.The primary energy resources in the Midwest come from fossil fuels. Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio combined represent 13% of the total coal production in the US, and it is the primary source of energy. Illinois was once a major producer of oil, and natural gas production has been increasing in Ohio.The negative effects of burning fossil fuels is that they release carbon dioxide, a dangerous greenhouse gas. This extra gas buildsup in the atmosphere, absorbing more and more… heat, and causing global warming, which is itself causing climate change. This increases the risk of droughts and ruin natural habitats.

      <h2>Ways to Help!</h2>
      <p class="w3-justify">
        <h3>Energy Conservation</h3>

<li>Switch to a renewable electricity supplier.</li>
<li>Buy A-rated electrical appliances.</li>
<li>Switch to energy saving light bulbs, when your old bulbs break. They last around 10 times longer than ordinary light bulbs; they will save you money and come in loads of different styles.</li>
<li>Items left on standby can use up to 85% of the energy they would use if fully switched on. Turn them off at the wall – it doesn’t take long.</li>
<li>Electric tumble dryers use a huge amount of energy. If it’s a nice day dry your clothes outside or even inside if it’s not so nice.</li>
<li>When using a washing machine ensure there is a full load and turn down the temperature.</li>
<li>If you have lights in your garden use solar powered lights that charge during the day and don’t require electricity.</li>
<li>Take your phone charger out of the wall. It uses energy even when it’s not charging your phone.

</li>
<li>When washing dishes by hand, don’t let the water run. Fill one basin with wash water and the other with rinse water.</li>
<li>Install an aerator on your kitchen faucet to reduce flow to less than 1 gallon per minute.</li>
<li>Use the garbage disposal sparingly. Alternatively, you can compost vegetable food waste and save gallons of water every time.</li>
<li>Install low-flow shower heads.</li>
<li>Take a five minute shower instead of a 10 minute one.</li>
<li>Turn your bathroom faucet off when brushing your teeth or shaving.</li>

<li>Water early in the morning or later in the evening when temperatures are cooler.</li>
<li>Adjust your sprinklers to ensure only your yard is being watered, not your house, sidewalk or street.</li>
<li>Put a layer of mulch around trees and plants to reduce evaporation and keep the soil cool.</li>
<li>Landscape your yard with climate appropriate plants.</li>
<li>Use a broom instead of a hose to clean driveways, sidewalks and patios.</li>
<li>Wash vehicles with a bucket and sponge, and make sure your hose has a self-closing nozzle.</li>
<h3>Other Ways to Take Action</h3>
<li>Contact City Council to set ordinances that regulate waste and chemical Use</li>
  <li>Get to know the rules of recycling.</li>
  <li>Ditch the plastic bags.</li>
  <li> Make a meal plan.</li>
  <li> Start relying on reusable containers.</li>
  <li>Start composting.</li>
  <li>Learn to repair rather than discard.</li>
  <li>Cancel unnecessary mail.</li>
  <li>Stop using disposable plates.</li>
  <li>Stop buying plastic water bottles. Buy reusable bottles.</li>
